## Why Are We Building This?

### Escalating Safety Concerns  
The tragic **August 2024 incident at R.G. Kar Medical College**, where a 31-year-old female trainee doctor was **raped and murdered on campus**, underscores the urgent need for enhanced safety measures for women — even in supposedly secure spaces.

### Inadequate Response Mechanisms  
**Delayed responses** and lack of immediate help in such cases highlight the **failure of traditional safety systems**. A real-time, smart alert system could mean the difference between life and death.

### Need for an Affordable, Discreet, and Accessible System  
Many existing safety products are:
- **Too costly**
- **Heavily internet-dependent**
- **Complicated to use**

**Aparajita** is designed to be:
-  **Affordable**
-  **Discreet & wearable**
-  **Easy to activate**
-  **Offline-capable**

- **Location-based risk analysis**  
  Tracks and maps high-risk areas based on user alerts and patterns — enabling both **prevention** and **preparedness**.
